The Patois CSV format
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Patois can export and import comma-separated-values files containg
language and word definitions.  The general format is CSV, as defined by
RFC 4180.  The character encoding is UTF-8.


Schema Version 1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Empty and whitespace-only cells are ignored at EOL.
Empty rows are ignored.

The first cell in each row is the "tag", identifying the row type.
Currently defined row types:

  - version row (tag: "V")
  - language row (tag: "L")
  - word row (tag: "W")


Version row
~~~~~~~~~~~

Only one version row is allowed per file, and it must be the first
non-empty row in the file.

Row content:

  - column 1: the string "V"
  - column 2: the string "Patois"
  - column 3: the schema version, as an integer (currently: 1)


Language rows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Language rows define new languages.

Row content:

  - column 1: the string "L"
  - column 2: the language code (an abbreviation of the language name)
  - column 3: the full language name


Word rows
~~~~~~~~~

Word rows define new words and the relationship between them.

Row content:

  - column 1: the string "W"
  - column 2k: the language code of the k-th word in the row
  - column 2k+1: the k-th word itself

The language codes (columns 2k) must have been defined before being used
in word definitions.

The first word on the line (columns 2 and 3) is the main word, and must
be present for the row to be valid.  The subsequent words are added as
translations (or synonyms) of the main word.  No relation is recorded
between the non-main words.  For instance, the line:

  W,de,die Kost,de,das Essen,en,food

will record that "food" in English is a translation for "die Kost" in
German, but it will not say that "food" in English is a translation for
"das Essen" in German.  If that is desired, a separate word row must be
used:

  W,de,das Essen,en,food,de,die Kost

Repeating the fact that "das Essen" and "die Kost" are synonyms is
harmless.

It is valid to have only the main word without translations: the word
will be added to the database as untranslated.

To avoid duplicates, each word (whether main word or not) will be looked
up in the database before adding it.  If the word is already present,
the existing word will be used.
