Patois is an Android app for practicing words in foreign languages.

To build it, you need to download and install the Android SDK:

    http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

Use 'git' to get the source:

    $ git clone git://github.com/dlzr/patois.git patois

Create a file called 'local.properties' specifying the location where
you installed the Android SDK:

    $ cd patois/
    $ echo "sdk.dir=/path/to/your/android/sdk" > local.properties

You should now be able to build the app with 'ant':

    $ ant debug

You now have the 'bin/patois-debug.apk' file which you can install with
'adb'.  You can also do the build and install steps in one go, like
this:

    $ ant install

Happy hacking!
