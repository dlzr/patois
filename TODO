Database:
  - Add triggers to the database to ensure consistency:
    - When adding/deleting a translation, update the "translations"
      count of the affected words (delete words with no translations
      left).
  - Add to words:
    - scores
    - date added
    - num translations

EditLanguagesActivity:
  - When deleting a language, first check that there are no words
    defined in that language.  If this is not true, ask the user for
    confirmation.

BrowseWordsActivity:
  - Words with no translations should be highlighted.
  - Add different sort orders

EditWordActivity:
  - When editting an existing translation for a word, ask the user if
    the new translation is a spelling correction, or a completely new
    word (i.e., a better translation).
  - When adding words, there should be checks for duplicates.

ViewWordActivity:
  - Implement me.

Serializable HOWTO:

When implementing the Serializable interface, the compiler recommends
that you also add the "serialVersionUID" static field to the
Serializable classes.  To generate it, use this command (run from the
top-level directory of the project):

    $ serialver -classpath \
        $ANDROID_SDK_DIR/platforms/android-1.5/android.jar:bin/classes/ \
        ro.undef.patois.EditWordActivity.TranslationEntry
