Database:
  - Add triggers to the database to insure consistency:
    - When deleting a language, all words in that language should be
      deleted too.
    - When deleting a word, all translations of that word should be
      deleted too.
    - When adding/deleting a translation, update the "translations"
      count of the affected words.

PatoisMainActivity:
  - When no "active language" is selected, prompt the user to select a
    language (if there are languages defined), or edit the languages (if
    there are no languages).

EditLanguagesActivity:
  - When deleting a language, first check that there are no words
    defined in that language.  If this is not true, ask the user for
    confirmation.

EditWordActivity:
  - When editting an existing translation for a word, ask the user if
    the new translation is a spelling correction, or a completely new
    word (i.e., a better translation).
