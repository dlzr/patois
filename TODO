Release HOWTO:

  - make sure a clean install works fine
  - run some basic tests while watching 'adb logcat'

Serializable HOWTO:

When implementing the Serializable interface, the compiler recommends
that you also add the "serialVersionUID" static field to the
Serializable classes.  To generate it, use this command (run from the
top-level directory of the project):

    $ serialver -classpath \
        $ANDROID_SDK_DIR/platforms/android-1.6/android.jar:bin/classes/ \
        ro.undef.patois.EditWordActivity.TranslationEntry
