IntroActivity:
  - Implement me.
  - Give a short tutorial (one screen).
  - Offer database import function.

MainActivity:
  - Add "About" dialog.
  - [2.0?] Remove this activity?  Replace it with
    BrowseWordsActivity?

EditLanguagesActivity:
  - When deleting a language, first check that there are no words
    defined in that language.  If this is not true, ask the user for
    confirmation.

BrowseWordsActivity:
  - Show some intro message if there are no words.
  - Find a different 'full circle' unicode char, one that's the same
    width as the star.

EditWordActivity:
  - BUG: when autocompleting, typing "al" doesn't match "all" or "alle".
  - Focus the 'name' field when adding a new translation.

ViewWordActivity:
  - Implement me.
  - Show:
    - word score
    - date added

PracticeActivity:
  - BUG: When editing the word from PracticeActivity, return to the same
    word in the same PracticeActivity, instead of returning to the
    MainActivity.
  - Rewrite PracticeActivity to not restart itself for each new word.
    This takes a lot of time (~400ms) currently, and introduces a
    visible lag in the UI.
  - Rephrase message when there are no words for practice.
  - Show word score in PracticeActivity.
  - Add animations when showing the answer.
  - [wish] When practicing "to Foreign", the foreign word should show up
    under the native translations.

  - Randomize the next_practice time by at most a day.
  - Fix the delay in the first training, it's currently too long.

Database:
  - [OK]

General:
  - Add unit tests.

Release HOWTO:

  - make sure a clean install works fine
  - run some basic tests while watching 'adb logcat'

Serializable HOWTO:

When implementing the Serializable interface, the compiler recommends
that you also add the "serialVersionUID" static field to the
Serializable classes.  To generate it, use this command (run from the
top-level directory of the project):

    $ serialver -classpath \
        $ANDROID_SDK_DIR/platforms/android-1.6/android.jar:bin/classes/ \
        ro.undef.patois.EditWordActivity.TranslationEntry
